<h1>Acton tutorial</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Acton is a general purpose programming language, designed to be useful
for a wide range of applications, from desktop applications to
embedded and distributed systems. In a first approximation Acton can be
described as a seamless addition of a powerful new construct to an
existing language: Acton adds <em>actors</em> to <em>Python</em>.
</p>
<p>
The aim of this document is to serve as a tutorial on Acton for a reader
familiar with Python. The presentation is mainly through examples,
chosen to illustrate both similarities and differences between the two
languages. As befits a tutorial, the examples are short and simple,
but we hope that they are chosen in a way that helps the reader to see how the
concepts illustrated scale to more complex situations. 
We also try to explain the considerations that has led the
Acton designers to deviate from Python, where this is the case. However,
the document is not a comprehensive description of the Acton language.
In fact, both the language definition and its implementation is
currently under active development, so some minor aspects of what we 
present here may be subject to change.
</p>

We recommend the reader to <a href="">download and install Acton</a>
and to play with the examples.

<h2>Background: Actors and Python</h2>
<p>
Before we turn to examples, we briefly discuss actors and Python and the
reasons for basing Acton on this foundation.
</p>
<ul>
 <li><p>
  The actor model for (concurrent) computation goes back to work by Carl
  Hewitt around 1970 and has been influential ever since, even though
  its direct impact on mainstream computation has been limited. However,
  recent developments, where multi-core processors have become ubiquitous
  and cloud computing is rapidly growing in importance, have put focus on
  the shortcomings of mainstream tools and methodologies for concurrent
  programming, based on shared memory and threads, requiring
  synchronization and coordination using locks and similar tools. Many
  observers have come to the conclusion that this methodology is
  inadequate in the current and future computing landscape. 
  </p>
 <p>
  Actors offer a promising approach to addressing this bottleneck by
  providing a simpler programming model. The notion of actors provides
  a conceptual framework, and concrete, actor-based languages and libraries
  take different forms. For our purposes, we think of
  an actor as an entity, which interacts with other actors only through
  message-passing. An actor may encapsulate some private state, which
  can be accessed and modified only through messages in its <em>interface</em>, a
  description of the message forms that the actor can handle. Each actor
  has a <em>mailbox</em>, i.e. a queue where incoming messages are stored,
  waiting to be processed. In response to receipt of a message an actor
  can perform some computation, send messages to other actors, create
  new actors and update its state. Sending a message is an
  asynchronous operation, i.e. the sender asks the runtime
  system to supply the necessary service (delivering the message in
  the receiver's mailbox) and can immediately proceed with its
  processing of the current message. 
  </p>
  <p>
  The runtime system guarantees that
  an actor only serves one message at a time, but of course several
  actors may be active in parallel. Therefore, actors can be used for
  synchronization and coordination of concurrent activities. It turns
  out that this simple and intuitive construct gives great power for
  concurrent and distributed programming, and suggests a programming
  style that naturally avoids common pitfalls.
 </p>
  <p>
  At the top level, an Acton program is an ensemble of actors.
  In-between processing messages, actors are idle, just maintaining
  their state. An intuitive view of an Acton system is therefore that it
  alternates between being idle and being engaged in a burst of
  activities in response to an incoming message. So, an Acton program is
  a <em>reactive</em> system. Also this notion has recently received a lot
  of attention, as witnessed by the <a href="https://www.reactivemanifesto.org">Reactive Manifesto</a>.
 </p>
  <p>
  In some respects actors can appear to be quite similar to class
  instances, which also maintain an internal state that can be
  manipulated through method calls. However, there are also major
  differences. We defer a fuller discussion of this to Example 3
below.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
  A major design decision in Acton is therefore to adopt the actor 
  programming model as a base for the large-scale structure of
  programs. It remains to embed this model in a concrete programming
  language, either as a library or middleware package in an existing
  language, or to design a new programming language. For reasons to 
  be discussed below, Acton is a new language, but is also very
  closely related to Python.
<p>
</p>
  Python has over many years acquired a large and enthousiastic user
  base. Programmers appreciate its light-weight syntax based on
  indentation and its native support for a variety of programming
  styles, including imperative, functional and object-oriented idioms.
  Acton capitalizes on this appeal by adopting Python syntax, making
  Acton immediately accessible to the Python programmer for programming
  in the small, i.e. defining functions and classes.
</p>
<p>
  Part of the appeal of Python lies also in the lack of variable and
  type declarations, accompanied by liberal polymorphism, dynamic
  typing and an interactive interpreter environment. All of this enables
  a quick development cycle, but it also implies that many errors in
  Python programs are caught only at runtime. Acton follows Python in
  the lack of declarations (it has the same syntax!), but adopts
  a much stricter discipline of
  static checks. In particular, Acton is statically typed with an
  expressive type language and type inference. Also, scope rules are
  modified to avoid runtime errors caused by uninitialized variables.
  See Examples 1 and 2 for more detail.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
At the syntax level, the addition of actors to the Python base just
means a new keyword <tt>actor</tt> and a new form of compound statement,
<tt>actor Name(params): suite</tt>, similar to class and function definitions.
Thus, in spite of the fact that Acton is a new language, it is
sufficiently close to Python that Python programmers will comfortably
transition to Acton programming. We would even dare to conjecture that
programming in Acton will come more natural than use of existing
libraries for programming with actors in Python. Also, many Python
library packages will also be valid Acton code.
</p>
<p>
For the Acton programmer, there is no notion of threads to consider
and no need of locks, semaphores or other low-level synchronisation
primitives. Threads enter instead at the level of the runtime system,
where a thread pool works on the collection of tasks formed by idle
actors with non-empty mailboxes, each thread repeatedly picking an
actor/message pair and executing the actor's message-processing code.
This implementation permits efficient utilization of multi-core
processors. Also distribution of tasks across machines can be done
transparently.
  </p>
<p>
The execution environment of an Acton program is also modelled by an
interface similar to that of an actor, i.e. we think of the external
world as an actor with which the program interacts. The interface to
this exterior world can vary greatly, depending on the type of
application and the computing environment, and an Acton installation may
offer one or more interfaces, with supporting runtime system.

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>
The rest of this tutorial consists of a sequence of short examples. In
connection with some of them we discuss Acton design decisions and
differences between Python and Acton.
</p>
<p>
As will become clear from the examples, Acton is a compiled language,
as C or Java.
Programs are written to files which are compiled to produce executable files,
which can be run. There is currently no interactive environment,
where programs can be developed and tested in a read/eval/print loop.
