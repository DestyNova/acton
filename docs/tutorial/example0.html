<h3>Example 0: Hello, world</h3>
<p>
We follow tradition and introduce Acton programming with the following
minimal example:

<pre>
actor main(env):
    print("Hello, world!")
</pre>
<p>
We already mentioned that an executing Acton program consists of a
collection of interacting actors. Here we have just a single actor,
which has been given the name <tt>main</tt>. By convention, the
<em>root actor</em> of a system takes a parameter <tt>env</tt> which
represents the execution environment, i.e. <tt>env</tt> has fields and
methods for accessing command line arguments, reading from and writing
to keyboard/screen and files, working with sockets etc. When the
program is executed, the runtime system creates the root actor,
hands it an <tt>env</tt> object and runs its initialization code, which here is
just a single command, to print a message on screen.
</p>
<p>
The careful reader may ask why <tt>print</tt> is not a method of
<tt>env</tt>. The answer is that we see <tt>print</tt> as a useful tool
for tracing program execution, and this should be
possible without having to thread an <tt>env</tt> parameter to all subunits.
</p>
<p>
To compile the program, assuming that it is saved in
<tt>world.act</tt>, the command is
</p>

<pre>
actonc world.act --root main
</pre>

<p>
This creates an executable file <tt>world</tt> in the same directory,
which can be run to see the familiar message.
</p>
<p>
Finally, let's modify the program to greet not the world, but a name
given on the command line:
</p>
<pre>
actor main(env):
    print("Hello, " + env.argv[1] + "!")
</pre>

<p>
The field <tt>env.argv</tt> is the list of command line arguments
(with element 0 the name of the shell command, and element 1 the first proper
argument).
