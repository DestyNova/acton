Processing of an incoming NETCONF RPC
=====================================

IP + TCP + receive buf + sockets in OS kernel

  |
  | stream of bytes, delivered in chunks by OS recv() syscall

  V

SSH impl 
     processes an encrypted stream consisting of ssh packets.
     After key exchange, the stream is decrypted and then deframed
     and demultiplexed, producing sequences of ssh packet streams,
     one per open ssh channel.

NETCONF subsystem
  One NETCONF session per SSH channel
  processes stream of channel data chunks
  produces sequence of NETCONF frames
